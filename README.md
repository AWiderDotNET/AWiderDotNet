# Help us Cast A Wider .NET!

This is the project / site that will eventually support the domain http://AWider.NET, in an attempt to foster more involvement in the .NET OSS world.

While there is no code in the repository yet, we hope you'll join us for planning discussions over the in the [issues section](https://github.com/SeanKilleen/AWiderDotNet/issues). We encourage you to start your own topics as well if they're not covered so we can think about how best to bring this project to fruition.
